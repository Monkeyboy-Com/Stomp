# Stomp
A file truncation utility. Stomp opens a file, truncates the content,
then closes the file. Very handy for clearing log files that are
being monitored.

Binary executables are available for Windows, Fedora/CentOS/RedHat, Debian/Ubuntu/Mint.

See the [Stomp Wiki](https://github.com/Corionis/Stomp/wiki) for details and downloads.
